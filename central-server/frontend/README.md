# Central Server Frontend

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for all styling. All previous CSS files and inline styles have been replaced with Tailwind utility classes.

## IoT Theme
- Modern, dark dashboard look
- Cyan accent color for IoT
- Responsive and accessible

## Development
- To install dependencies: `npm install`
- To start: `npm start`
- To build: `npm run build`

## Customizing Theme
Edit `tailwind.config.js` to adjust colors, fonts, or extend the theme.

## Removing Old CSS
No `.css` files are used except for Tailwind imports. If you add new components, use Tailwind classes only.
